*******************************************

1. Introduction to Shell and Environment Setup

* What is Shell? (Bash, Zsh, Ksh, etc.)
* Shell vs. Terminal vs. Bash
* Installing and Setting Up Bash (Linux/macOS/WSL for Windows)
* Essential Configuration Files (~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc)
* Setting Up a DevOps-Friendly Shell Environment
  -PS1 Prompt Customization
  -Useful Aliases and Functions
  -Environment Variables ($PATH, $HOME, $USER)
*************************************************
2. Basic Scripting Skills

* Writing Your First Shell Script (.sh file, shebang #!/bin/bash)
* Executing Scripts (chmod +x script.sh, ./script.sh, bash script.sh)
* Variables and Data Types (String, Integer, Arrays)
* reading User Input (read command)
* Basic Operators (Arithmetic, Relational, Logical)
* Control Flow:
  -Conditional Statements (if-else, case)
  -Looping (for, while, until)
* Functions in Shell Scripts
* Exit Codes and Status ($?, exit command)

**********************************************
3. Intermediate Scripting Techniques

* Working with Files and Directories (ls, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, find)
* String Manipulation (sed, awk, cut, tr)
* File Permissions and Ownership (chmod, chown, umask)
* Input and Output Redirection (>, >>, <, 2>, &>)
* Process Management (ps, top, kill, nohup, &, jobs, fg, bg)
* Cron Jobs and Task Automation (crontab -e, at, systemd timers)
* Working with Logs (tail -f, grep, awk for parsing logs)

**************************************************
4. Advanced Scripting and Debugging

* Writing Robust Scripts with Error Handling (set -e, trap, ||, &&)
* Debugging Techniques (bash -x script.sh, set -x, set -v)
* Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching (grep -E, sed -r)
* Advanced File Processing (awk, sed, xargs, cut, paste)
* Networking with Shell Scripts (ping, curl, wget, netstat, ss)
* Parallel Execution and Background Jobs (&, wait, xargs -P)
* Working with APIs in Shell Scripts (cURL for REST API calls)
* Secure Shell Scripting (ssh, scp, sftp, expect)

*******************************************
5. Real-World Applications and Integration

* Shell Scripting in DevOps Pipelines (CI/CD Integration)
* Automating AWS/GCP/Azure Operations (aws-cli, gcloud, az-cli)
* Automating Kubernetes Tasks (kubectl, helm, jq, yq)
* Writing System Health Checks & Monitoring Scripts
* Backup and Restore Automation
* Log Parsing and Analysis with Shell Scripting

*******************************
6. Shell Mastery and Continuous Learning

* Writing Modular & Reusable Shell Scripts
* Best Practices for Readable and Maintainable Shell Scripts
* Shell Scripting Performance Optimization
* Learning Alternative Shells (Zsh, Fish, Dash)
* Moving Beyond Shell: When to Use Python, Ansible, or Terraform
* Keeping Up with DevOps Industry Trends

***************************************
7. Projects to Keep Up with the Industry

* Automated Log Monitoring & Alert System
- Parses logs, filters errors, and sends alerts via email or Slack.
* Infrastructure Backup Automation
- Automates backup of critical files, databases, or VM snapshots.
* CI/CD Pipeline Helper
- Automates repository cloning, testing, and deployment tasks.
* System Health Check Script
- Checks CPU, Memory, Disk Usage, Running Services, and Network Status.
* Kubernetes Resource Monitor
- Automates collection of Kubernetes cluster metrics for monitoring.
* AWS Instance Management Script
- Starts/stops AWS EC2 instances on demand or based on schedule.
